Robot

You have a warehouse that is a rectangular grid.   You can show 
this with a 2D grid of boxes with touching edges.   You have a robot
that occupies a single square of the grid.   Indicate this by putting
"R" in that box.  There are 4 buttons, north, south, east, west.
When you hit one of the buttons, the robot moves
one square in that direction (but not off the grid).  

Let's make the grid 5x5 for now, but try to use variables, so we
can adjust later.

Submit your .dart file to blackboard.  Put you name in it, and
use comments and all that.
