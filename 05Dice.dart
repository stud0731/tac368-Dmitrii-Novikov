Dice

There are two goals here.  
1. Set up a project with git so I can see it.
2. Write a program that lets you roll dice.

1. Open a terminal window.  Instructions here with ">"
are in that window.  Instructions with "..." are in
VSCode or something else.


> flutter create bob_dice
... where 'bob' is your name.  
> cd bob_dice
> git init

... open VSCode, select folder bob_dice
... go to version control tab (3rd down on left)
... check to see if you are on 'main' branch.  If not,
> git branch -M main

... "first commit" and commit

... Log into your github account.  Make an account if needed.
... on your github create bob_dice .  Do NOT make a README.

> git remote add origin https://github.com/professorprism/bob_dice.git
> git push -u origin 

... at this point, if you go to the 'code' tab on github, you should
see the project.  

note: The first time I did ' ... add origin ...' command I 
misspelled something. It looked happy but the push did not work.  
When I tried to reset the origin, I got the error
error: remote origin already exists.
I had to 
> git remote remove origin
than re-do it with the right spelling.  Then push.

... Once you are able to push your project to GitHub, 
share it with me professorprism.

The actual program for today is Dice.  Make an app that lets
you press a button and roll a dice (die).  If that is easy,
you can put in 5 dice, roll all at once.  And if you want more 
to do, put a hold button each dice so that when you roll them,
the ones on hold do not change.

You should push this, and I should be able to find it.

-----------
Comands to restart if it gets tangled up:

> git pull origin main
   It said I had to specify how to resolve divergent branches.
> git config pull.rebase true
> git pull origin main
   And that copied the stuff.
